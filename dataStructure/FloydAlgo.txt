used on linked list:

1. Uses fast and slow pointers, f & s. f increses by 2 and s by 1.
2. Used to check whether a circular linked linked list is present if fast and slow meets.
3. Used in finding the length of the circular linked list. First detect whether it has circular or not. Then fix the f and start iterating s and when it reaches f after traveling the nodes count those nodes to give the length of the circular nodes.
4. Used to find the starting circular index positon. First detect whether circular is present then take another pointer temp from head. Increment the temp by 1 and s by 1 where they meet is the starting circular index.
5. Used to find the middle index of any linked list excpecially if even number of nodes are present then it finds the second middle node always.
